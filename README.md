## Hangman Game

Welcome to Hangman Game! This is a simple console-based game where you guess letters to reveal a hidden word.


## How to Play

Run the hangman.py file in your Python environment.
You will be prompted to guess a letter.
Enter your guess.
If the letter is correct, it will be revealed in the hidden word.
If the letter is incorrect, part of the hangman will be drawn.
Keep guessing letters until you either reveal the entire word (win) or the hangman is complete (lose).
